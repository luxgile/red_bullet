# RED BULLET
_Unfinished game created for [One Shot Showdown Gamejam](https://itch.io/jam/one-shot-showdown)_

The idea was to create a Vampire Survivor game, the catch: Every weapon only has a single bullet. 

Given personal reasons and using Odin (which I've never used in the past) for this game, the project was not finished on time. However it was very useful to learn the following:
- Building for web.
- Web common issues (Managing game loop and problems with shaders)
- Developing a game with a very simple programing language (C-like).
- Don't overscope, no need to create an engine, just build the game.

Some features that I'd like to add but are missing:
- Sound effects
- More enemies (Mainly to avoid agrupations) 
- More weapons
